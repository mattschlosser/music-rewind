# Music Rewind

Shows your YouTube Music history in a nice sorted list, based on what you've played most. 

Keeps data local and processes everything on client side. Your history is not uploaded anywhere. 

[Visit the demo](https://music.mattschlosser.me)

### To fix:

- [x] Click on a song to listen to it
- [ ] Add a chart to show listening habits over time
- [ ] Fix UI Hanging on large history upload (JS workers?).
